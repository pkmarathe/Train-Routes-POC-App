# SPX ATON Project

## Design Decisions

### Design Patterns Used:
- **Strategy Pattern** for calculating various types of routes.
- **Dependency Injection** for enhancing testability.

### Test Cases:
Implemented to validate the requirements:
1. Distance of specific routes (A=>B=>C).
2. Validation of non-existing routes.
3. Shortest route calculation.
4. Number of trips with specific conditions (e.g., stops, distance).

## Running the Application
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure `Input.txt` is in the project directory.
3. Run the `Program.cs` file to execute the tests and display results.
